## hidden mysteries behind **big mobile codebases.**

### 'reloaded edition' ###

#### <br>@fernando_cejas

^ You have a really cool and impactful project, but as soon as your codebase gets bigger, and more and more contributors come into play, things can become challenging in regards to aspects like: code consistency, technical debt, refactoring, application architecture and team organization. Let's jump onboard on this journey and walk through different techniques that can help us keep our code sane and healthy for better scalability. 
Disclaimer: This talk is going to be focused from a mobile standpoint but most of the practices included can also be applied to any software project under development.

# **This begins with a story...**
 
- You are a happy developer
- You have a lightweight pet project
- You are the only maintainer

^ The project is like a baby for you.

^ Easy to maintain.
^ Technical decisions are made by only one person.
^ No conflicts on the code.

# **At some point in time...**

- Project starts to grow...
- More features are required...
- You are extremely happy for its success...

^ Someone believe in that project.

# **Success under the hoods**

- Codebase grows.
- No tests.
- Inconsistency across the code.

# **Unsustainable situation. Why?**

- More requirements/features.
- More contributors.
- Time to market and dealines.
- Complexity going up.

# **Many questions to answer.**

- Can we add a new functionality fast?
- Is our codebase prepare to scale?
- Is it hard to maintain? 
- What about technical debt?
- How to keep it healthy and sane?
- Is it easy to onboard new people?
- What about our team organization?

# Fact **#3**

_**Code evolution implies:**_


- Constant refactoring.
- Exploring new technologies.
- Taking new approaches.

---

![](img/background.jpg)

# **Refactoring**

- Code evolution.
- Boy scouting.
- Baby steps.

---

# **Code to refactor:**

```java
	private void startProcessing(Map<MyKeyEnum, String> map) {
	    Processor myProcessor = new Processor();
	    for (Entry entry : map.entrySet()) {
	        switch(entry.getKey()) {
	            case KEY1:
	                myProcessor.processStuffAboutKey1(entry.getValue());
	                break;
	            case KEY2:
	                myProcessor.processStuffAboutKey2(entry.getValue());
	                break;
	            case KEY3:
	                myProcessor.processStuffAboutKey3(entry.getValue());
	                break;
	            case KEY4:
	                myProcessor.processStuffAboutKey4(entry.getValue());
	                break;
	            ...
	            ...
	        }
	    }
	}
```

^ This code clearly violates the open close SOLID principle, which stands that a class should be open for extension and close for modification. 

---

# **Create an abstraction:**

```java
	public interface KeyProcessor {
	    void processStuff(String data);
	}
```

---

# **Fill a map with implementation:**

```java
	Map<Key, KeyProcessor> processors = new HashMap<>();
	processors.add(key1, new Key1Processor());
	...
	...
	processors.add(key4, new Key2Processor());
```

---

# **Use the map in the loop:**

```java
	for (Entry<Key, String> entry: map.entrySet()) {
	    Key key = entry.getKey();
	    KeyProcessor keyProcessor = processors.get(key);
	    if (keyProcessor == null) {
	        throw new IllegalStateException("Unknown processor for key " + key);
	    }
	    final String value = entry.getValue();
	    keyProcessor.processStuff(value);
	}
```

^ Now you are not touching your domain anymore, you just need to add a new processo to your processors Map

---

![](img/background.jpg)

# Fact **#4**

_**Rely on a good test battery that backs you up.**_

^ Why is this important? Technical debt, refactoring, introducing new things to your codebase. 

---

![](img/background.jpg)

# **Technical debt**

### "Indebted code is any code that is hard to scan." 
### "Technical debt is anything that increases the difficulty of reading code."

- Anti-patterns.
- Legacy code.
- Abandoned code.
- Code without tests.

_**Do not let technical debt beat you.**_

_**Favor code readability over performance unless the last one is critical for your business.**_

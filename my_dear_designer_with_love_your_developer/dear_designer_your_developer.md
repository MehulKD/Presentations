## My dear **DESIGNER**... 
### ...with **LOVE**... 
## Your **DEVELOPER**...

^ John Keats was an English Romantic poet and in one of his most famous letters, he tells next door neighbor Fanny Brawne he cannot live without her (1819): "My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you - I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again."
This hidden love between developers and designers really exists and we must take advantage of it in order to design and develop great products.
Jump onboard in this journey and let's explore this charming relationship, based on real use cases and experiences for creating awesome product features and functionalities.

## Android Design for fun and profit

^ Last time I talked seriously about design was in 2013: https://speakerdeck.com/android10/android-ux-ui-design-patterns 
Then in 2015 I talked about material design, at a more technical level, but still with a huge hangover after the conference's party the previous night.

### Hello World **Mobile Product Designer**

^ Definition: It is someone that assembles de puzzle and put all the pieces together. It is more on the side of visual and UX, rather than implementation details. Coordination. Can also create deliverables.

### Job **underestimation**?

^ Let's put it this way: What it is easy for developers, it is not for designers (slide 4): https://speakerdeck.com/georgiknox/design-hacks-for-developers. There is a job underestimation from both sides (we will see that is not true)

How can **we** work together and **design/develop** cool products?

^ Behaviour and the personal factor comes to the surface when we need to team up and work together

![](img/right_brain_left_brain.jpg)

^ Let's explore the brain hemispheres to understand a little bit better what happens at this level. 
^ It looks like the brain is the perfect combination for achieving our goals right?
^ So we are compatible but at the same time incompatible...which makes a perfect? relationship.

## How can **developers** help **designers**?

- Give know-how on what is viable or not.
- Give an overview on how things work. 
- Provide constructive design critique.
- With a different perspective: based on experience or functionality.

^ Constraints
^ Provide a different perspective: more focused on the experience or functionality

---

![](img/background_main.jpg)

## How can **designers** help **developers**?

- Use an actual asset management or version control system.
- Keep everything as vectors, and scaleable effects.
- Use the platform's idioms.
- Use realistic content.

^ Lorem ipsum is not found anywhere in the design

---

![](img/background_main.jpg)

## How can we work **together**?

- Establish a clear and consistent workflow.
- Never assume it is easy.
- Don't micro manage.
- Mutual respect.
- Work in a harmonious, cross-collaborative environment.
- Creativity exists in both sides.
- Feedback is key from both sides.

^ Mutual respect gets rid of the us and them mindset. It helps develop better relationships by creating a happier environment.
^ We both approach problem from different angles. Creativity exists in both sides.

### Moral of the fable:

#### "**Better products** result when your creative mind and dev's analytical genius **work together.**"

#### "The creation of product is a partnership between **graphic design, interaction design, and implementation.** None of these disciplines is any less important than another, and **all are vital.**"

#### "**Design and development** are two inseparable halves of the process of creating **quality software.**"	


^ Everything is about communication. Work in harmony.
^ The creation of any kind of software is (or should be) a partnership between graphic design, interaction design, and implementation. None of these disciplines is any less important than another, and all are vital. By being aware of the needs of those working in other fields, we can be more effective and valuable in our own work.
^ Design and development are two inseparable halves of the process of creating quality software. Professionals on both sides should always strive to work together as effectively and respectfully as possible.
^ If I adapt to their processes, they adapt to my processes. If I respect their time, they respect my time, and if I get them involved, they’ll get me involved too. It works both ways. We all win.
